# plugged.sh
The Plugged.in Script to Auto-Deploy LAMP on CentOS

Currently works with CentOS 6.x, CentOS 7.x is under development branch.
There are also two scripts to install Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 for CentOS when necessary.

Each plugged.sh script has it's own instructions upon execution. They're not prompted, but argument based scripts so simply run the scripts with necessary arguments and get a cup of coffee.
